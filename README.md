# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Solve-the-8-Puzzle
The primary objective of this research is to investigate the potential of machine learning and deep learning models to serve as learned heuristics for the A* search algorithm, potentially replacing traditional hand-crafted heuristics in puzzle solving domains.
